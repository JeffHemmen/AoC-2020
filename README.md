# Advent of Code 2019
See: https://adventofcode.com/2019

These are my solutions for the Advent of Code challenge 2019, written in **Python 3**.

Each day is a self-contained problem, and has its own directory.  
Typically, there is a file called `input.txt` with my given input, and one or more Python files.

Usage, for day `n`:

```
cd "Day ${n}"
./day${n}.py
```
