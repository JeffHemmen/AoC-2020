# Advent of Code 2020
See: https://adventofcode.com/2020

These are my solutions for the Advent of Code challenge 2019, written in **Go**.

Each day is a self-contained problem, and has its own directory.  
Typically, there is a file called `input.txt` with my given input, and two Go files.

Usage, for day `n` (01â€“25):

```
cd "day-${n}"
go run part1.go
go run part2.go
```
